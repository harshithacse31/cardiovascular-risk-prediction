# cardiovascular-risk-prediction
 focuses on predicting the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using logistic regression. By analyzing a dataset from the Framingham cardiovascular study, which includes demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors, the model aims to identify key contributors to heart disease. This research supports early detection and prevention, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions for high-risk patients. The project contributes to cardiovascular disease prevention and public health improvement.
